Operating Systems - Principles and Practice

Volume 1 - Kernels and Processes

OS => (1) referee (2) illusionist (3) glue 

Kernel Abstraction => 

process => execution of application with restricted rights 
	=> protection is provided by os kernel 

process abstraction
	=> program executuble => compiler's output machine code and data 
	=> execution stack => holds local variables during procedure calls 
	=> heap => memory to dynamically allocate data structures for program 

OS execution 
	=> set stack pointer
	=> jump into first instruction 

Analogy
	process => program
	object => class 

Process Control Block 
	=> data structure that keeps track of various processes 
	=> contains information about process 
		-> where it is stored in memory
		-> where executuble image is stored in disk 
		-> which user asked to execute 
		-> privileges of process 
		-> etc 

program consistes of concurrent activites => threads 
	- each thread has separate program counter and stack 
	- process = multiple threads 

dual operation mode 
	- 

Programming Interface 

Volume 2 - Concurrency

Volume 3 - Memory Management 

Volume 4 - Persistent Storage
