Lecture 1

Compute prime factor for billion numbers 

Divide Problem up

Lecture 2 - Memory Heirarchies and Matrix Multiplication 

Single Processors 
	- 

Idealized Uniprocessor Model 
	- 

Compilers and Assembly Code 
	- manages memory and registers 
		- uses graph coloring algorithm
	- JIT compilers don't use coloring algo 

Compiler Performs Optimizations
	- Unrolls Loops
	- Fuses Loops
	- Interchanges Loops
	- Eliminates Dead Code
	- Reorders instructions to improve register reuse
	- Strength Reduction

Realistic Uniprocessor Model 
	
Latency and Bandwith
