# Basics

elements of compilation 
essentials of compilation

## Introduction 
- functional programming
	- functions are first-class values
	- programs are equivalent to mathematical functions 

## Data and Functions
- type = set of data values 
- simpl.

		- Rev defintion 
- Ltac refl := reflexivity 
- Option map in coq is equal to a functor in Haskell 
- Left versus right folds 
- app = append 
- simpl = simply 
- constfun = kcombinator (sk-combinators) = const in Haskell
