# CS 144 by Adam Wierman 

# Lecture - Jan 23rd

- Recap 
	- 4 nearly universal properites of networks 
		- giant connected component
		- small diameter
		- heavy-tailed degree? 

- High clustering coefficient
- Small diameter 

- Small world graphs
- Youtube has recommendations 
- What is th emodel that has high clustering and short paths 

- GNP algorithm 
	- Apply it to a lattice 
	- Rewrite edges to become new long-distance edges 

- Can myopic distributed agents find short paths? 
	- Kleinberg variation 

- Myopic agesnt find paths of length Omega(sqrt(n))
	- 1D Proof 
		- Determine path from source to sink 

- Section 20.3 of networks book 
	- decentralized search 

- Dynamic graphs with arriving and departing nodes, requires a larger alpha 

Questions
- Are there lecture notes I can access? 
	- I could not find the conspiracy and catastrophe principle in the course text
	- Is there source text for the 1D proof in class? 
- Are there homework questions I can access? 
- Is there a class schedule with information of intended lectures? 
- Are there research opportunities I can pursue?
