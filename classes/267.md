# CS 267
## Lecture 1

Compute prime factor for billion numbers 

Divide Problem up

## Lecture 2 - Memory Heirarchies and Matrix Multiplication 

- Single Processors 
	- 

- Idealized Uniprocessor Model 
	- 

- Compilers and Assembly Code 
	- manages memory and registers 
		- uses graph coloring algorithm
	- JIT compilers don't use coloring algo 

- Compiler Performs Optimizations
	- Unrolls Loops
	- Fuses Loops
	- Interchanges Loops
	- Eliminates Dead Code
	- Reorders instructions to improve register reuse
	- Strength Reduction

- Realistic Uniprocessor Model 
	
- Latency and Bandwith 

## Lecture 4

- Shared Memory 
	- program = collection of threads of control

- Synchronize shared variables 

- POSIX threads 
	- PThreads = posix threading interface 

- Parallelism in loops

- Data race 
	- Multiple threads of exection access same variable 
		- At least one of them does a write 
	- Createa a mutex then deallocate a mutex 

- openMP 
	- open specification of multi processing 

- OpenMP basic defintions 
	- /# pragma omp parallel 
	- fork join parallelism 
		- master thread spawns team of threads
		- parallelism incrementally added until performance goals met 
	- Amdhal's Law 
	- Serial pi program 

- Basic Shared Memory Architecture 
	- Caches reduce average latency 
	- Cache Coherence Problem
		- How can modifications in one cache be updated to all caches 
		- Understand write back caches
	- False sharing
