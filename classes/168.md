# CS 168: Internet Architecture and Protocols 

# Lecture 1

- Defintion of Internet 
	- Infrastructure that ties together computing devices 
		- e.g. TCP, IP, BGP, DNS, OSPF
	- Ecosystem of applications on top of infra 

# Lecture 2 

- Packets = chunk of bits 
	- Two Parts
		- Payload
			- meaningful only to endpoints 
				- bits from file 
		- Header(s)
			- meaningful to network and endpoint 
				- address 

- Flow 
	- Stream of packets exchanged between two endpoints 

- Links = propagation delay * bandwidth 
	- bandwidth (width)
		- number of bits sent per unit time (bps)
	- propagation delay (length)
		- time for bit to travel link (sec)
	- bandwidth-delay product => BDP (capacity)
		- (bits/time) * time => (bits)

- Switches 
	- Forwards packets 

- Life of packet 
	- Source -> Link -> Switch -> Link -> Destination

- Network Address = host location 
- Network Name = which host 

- Routing 

- Control Plane = mechanism to compute forwarding tables 
	- Properties 
		- Global
- Data Plane = mechanism to forward packets using tables 
	- Properties 
		- Local 

- Statistical Multiplexing 
	- Combine demands to share resoruces efficiently
		- Peak of aggregate demand << aggregate of peak demands
	- Don't provision for worst case (everything peaks at once)

- Sharing Approaches 
	- Reservations (Circuit Switching)
		- Reserve network capacity for all packets to flow 
		- Steps 
			- (1) source sends reservation request to destination
			- (2) switches "establish a circuit" 
			- (3) source starts sending data
			- (4) source sentds "teardown circuit" message 
		- Resources shared between flows in system 
	- Best-effort (Packet Switching)
		- Allocate resources to each packet independently 
			- Independent across both switches and packets 
		- Resources shared between packets in systems 

- Travel Time  
	- Packet Delay = Packet Size / Link Bandwidth) + Propogation Delay 



# Lecture 3: Architectural Principles 

- Circuit = Path that satisifies network flow requirements 

- Circuit vs. Packet Switching 
	- Abstraction
	- Efficiency at scale 
	- Handling failures at scale 
	- Complexity of implementation 

- Application Viewpoint 

- Modularity 

- Network System Modularity 
	- Need for modularity is more important for the internet

- Network is implemented across many lines of code 
	- Distributed across many devices 

- Packets in flight 
	- Switch 
	- Transient overload 
		- Queue -> absorbs transient boards 
		- Packet scheduling decision used 
		- Drains Queue 
	- Persistent overload 
		- Network drops packets once queue is full 

- Travel Time with Queues
	- Packet Delay = Packet Size / Link Bandwidth) + Propogation Delay + Queue Delay 

- Decompose job of transfer data from end hosts 

- Analogy 
	- Sending letter through fedex 
		- Letter with packaging 
			- Writer Envelope 
			- Sender Aid Evelope 
			- Fedex Envelope 
		- Sent through distribution facility 

- Breakdown into tasks 
	- bits across a wire 
	- packets across a wire 
	- deliver packets across local network 

- Internet: Organization -> Layered Architecture 
	- Physical transfer of bits -> l1 physical
	- Best-effort local packet delivery -> l2 data link 
	- Best-effort global packet delivery -> l3 network 
	- Reliable data delivery -> l4 transport 
	- Applications -> l7 application 

- Ancient layers

	- l6 presentation

# Lecture 5: Routing Fundamentals 

- Packets
	- Metadata 
		- Source Addrress
		- Destination Address 
		- Type 
		- Version 
	- Data Payload 
		- e.g. html code

- What is a router 
	- Switch 
	- Intermediate node that connects to multiple neighbors 

- Challenge of Routing 
	- When packet reaches router, how does it know where to send it next? 
	- Determine good paths
		- Minimize cost, minimze competitor routers, minimize hops 
		- Avoid random routing

- Goal: determine good routing algorithm 

- Example networks 
	- UUNET, Century Link 
	- Berkeley Campus Network 
	- Data Center Topologies 
	- Internet 

- Every topology is dynamic 
	- Router can fail at any point 

- Challege of Forwarding 
	- Determine which neighbor to send recently arrived packet 
	- Solution: Use a table 
		- Next hop table -> which neighbor router to send data to 
		- Port table -> which port to send data to 

- Forwarding
	- Inherently local 
		- Look at destination value from table 
			- Depends on arriving packet and local table
		- Primary responsibility of router's data plane 
		- Time: per packet arrival (nano seconds)

- Routing 
	- Inherently global 
		- Communicated with other routers to determine how to populate tables 
			- Must know all destinations, not just local destinations 
		- Primary responsibility of router's control plane 
		- Time: per network event (per failure)
	
- Delivery Trees 
	- Directed Delivery Tree
	- Oriented Spanning Tree 

- Routing State Validity 
	- Good path => packets reaches destination 
	- Local routing state 
		- Contants of table in single router 
	- Global routing state 
		- Produces forwarding decisions that deliver packets to destinations 

- RSV Theorem 
	- Neceassary and sufficient condition for validity 
		- For each destination, there are 
			- (1) no dead ends 
			- (2) no loops
	- Dead End = no outgoing link 
	- Loop = packet cycles around same set of nodes 

- Compute Valid State
