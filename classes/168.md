- Packets
	- Metadata 
		- Source Addrress
		- Destination Address 
		- Type 
		- Version 
	- Data Payload 
		- e.g. html code

- What is a router 
	- Switch 
	- Intermediate node that connects to multiple neighbors 

- Challenge of Routing 
	- When packet reaches router, how does it know where to send it next? 
	- Determine good paths
		- Minimize cost, minimze competitor routers, minimize hops 
		- Avoid random routing

- Goal: determine good routing algorithm 

- Example networks 
	- UUNET, Century Link 
	- Berkeley Campus Network 
	- Data Center Topologies 
	- Internet 

- Every topology is dynamic 
	- Router can fail at any point 

- Challege of Forwarding 
	- Determine which neighbor to send recently arrived packet 
	- Solution: Use a table 
		- Next hop table -> which neighbor router to send data to 
		- Port table -> which port to send data to 

- Forwarding
	- Inherently local 
		- Look at destination value from table 
			- Depends on arriving packet and local table
		- Primary responsibility of router's data plane 
		- Time: per packet arrival (nano seconds)

- Routing 
	- Inherently global 
		- Communicated with other routers to determine how to populate tables 
			- Must know all destinations, not just local destinations 
		- Primary responsibility of router's control plane 
		- Time: per network event (per failure)
	
- Delivery Trees 
	- Directed Delivery Tree
	- Oriented Spanning Tree 

- Routing State Validity 
	- Good path => packets reaches destination 
	- Local routing state 
		- Contants of table in single router 
	- Global routing state 
		- Produces forwarding decisions that deliver packets to destinations 

- RSV Theorem 
	- Neceassary and sufficient condition for validity 
		- For each destination, there are 
			- (1) no dead ends 
			- (2) no loops

- Compute Valid State
