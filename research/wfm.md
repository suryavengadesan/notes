# Performance Characterization of Scientific Machine Learning Workflows

## Abstract

## Introduction
- workflow management systems
    - run workflows on distributed infra, hpc systems, or cloud
- execution platforms
    - Chameleon (NSF funded cloud)

## General Characterization
- panorama 
    - capture workflow I/O, CPU util, and GPU util traces

# Levaraging Reinforcement Learning for Task Resoure Allocation in Scientific Workflows

## Related Work
- SmartYARN
- DeepRM
    - state space = cluster's resources
    - actions = choose job and allocate resources to it
- VCONF
    - allocating virtual machine with RL 

## Evaluation
- SWMS Nextflow
    - fathers runtime metrics from linux process stats
